GPU Parallelism with PyOpenCL
==============================

Parallel programming seminar tought by [André Brodtkorb](https://github.com/babrodtk) on [ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es).

Content on the influence of parallel programming today were taught, and improve the performance of most programs with their pros and cons as to the sizes of the problems etc ...

Also different results as affecting perform costly calculation process in CPU and GPU so that they could observe the advantages and disadvantages of one against another were exposed.

In practice part OpenCL has used to calculate:

- **The Heat Equation**: that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over the time.
- **The Wave Equation**: that describes the physics of a wave, such as sound waves, light waves and water waves.
